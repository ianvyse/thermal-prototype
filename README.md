# thermal-prototype
This repository contains multiple iterations of a Python program that simulates the temperature in a specific volume with set dimensions given insulation properties and dimensions. This code was written as a prototype to understand more about a conceptual design that the team developed in ESC102 Praxis II, an engineering design course. You can see a brief summary of the conceptual design in the one-pager below.
